# FastaHeaderChanger
A simple script to change header lines of fasta files downloaded from GenBank

Normally we download sequences from NCBI GenBank for our phylogenetics needs. I normally prefer fasta files. Those fasta files have a very long header line for each sequences. Such header lines have to be shortened for further analyses. This script is intented to do that. You may donload and modify the lines to suit your needs. My code may not work for you. I use it in linux terminal with the command:

python ~/dir/where/the/code/is/saved/change_ncbi_fasta_headers.py

Then it asks for raw inputs. Provide absolute paths to files.

Earlier the files used to be in a different format with GI numbers. Nowadays it is in a different format, so I just use the "new" option.
